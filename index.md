# Getting Started

Before the workshop, please consider taking a moment to complete the
following steps: 1) Download the latest version of R statistical
environment from the website here: <https://cran.cmm.msu.ru/> .  
2) Though not required, you will probably find it helpful to also
download RStudio: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> .
For our purposes, the free “RStudio Desktop” version will work just
fine. - If you’re not familiar with RStudio at all, [Chapter 1 of this
online textbook](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/getting-started.html)
provides a gentle introduction.  
3) During the workshop, we will be using the following packages, so if
you are able to install R, please also consider installing them ahead of
time. Note that you should only need to install the package once (unless
you later re-install or update R). From then on, you can call the
package into your library by using the “library()” or “require()”
functions.  
– [*tidyverse*](): Data manipulation  
– [*dplyr*](): Data manipulation  
– [*psych*](): Creating quick descriptive summaries of data  
– [*metafor*](): Meta-analysis  
– [*robumeta*](): Robust variance estimation meta-analysis  
– [*ggplot2*](): Plotting

Most of these packages have packages dependencies (i.e., other packages
they use), so you may notice other packages getting installed, as well.
