# Getting Started  
Before the workshop, please consider taking a moment to complete the following steps:  
1) Download the latest version of R statistical environment from the website here: https://cran.cmm.msu.ru/ .    
2) Though not required, you will probably find it helpful to also download RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ . For our purposes, the free "RStudio Desktop" version will work just fine.   
- If you're not familiar with RStudio at all, [Chapter 1 of this online textbook](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/getting-started.html) provides a gentle introduction.    
3) During the workshop, we will be using the following packages, so if you are able to install R, please also consider installing them ahead of time. Note that you should only need to install the package once (unless you later re-install or update R). From then on, you can call the package into your library by using the "library()" or "require()" functions.     
-- [*tidyverse*](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/): Data manipulation  
-- [*dplyr*](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/): Data manipulation  
-- [*psych*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html): Creating quick descriptive summaries of data  
-- [*metafor*](https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php): Meta-analysis   
-- [*robumeta*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/robumeta/index.html): Robust variance estimation meta-analysis  
-- [*ggplot2*](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): Plotting  

Most of these packages have packages dependencies (i.e., other packages they use), so you may notice other packages getting installed, as well.

## Pre-registration of Systematic Reviews  
- [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/): For pre-registration of health-related systematic reviews.    
- [Research Registry](https://www.researchregistry.com/): Altnerative to PROSPERO that does not restrict systematic reviews to those related to human health. However, also costs money to submit a pre-registration.    
- Many other alternatives, as well, that are not specific to systematic reviews, including the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/prereg/), [AsPredicted.Org](https://aspredicted.org/), etc.

# the theory and rationale of meta-analysis
# identifying and developing research questions appropriate for meta-analysis
# creating and protocol for the systematic review and drafting a pre-registration
# accessing and organizing citations
# PRISMA procedure for screening articles (and tools for collaborative article screening)
# procedures for data extraction and establishing inter-coder reliability
# other resources for evaluating the quality of the systematic review

#For the effect size calculation and moderator/meta-regression analysis, I can plan to give some demos that involve the use of two R packages (metafor, robumeta) for analyzing the data. I should be able to pull some toy data to use for the latter portion to get some hands-on experience running the analyses. If it would be of interest, I'd like to focus on two types of meta-analysis: one which focuses on correlations as effect size estimates, and the other which focuses on group mean differences as effect size estimates.
